# Project 3: Spots

### Overview
  
**Intro**
  
Spots is a responsive website that allows users to upload images or photos with descriptions, which can be liked by other users. The site was designed for a desktop resolution of 1440 pixels and adapts seamlessly to mobile screens starting at 740 pixels.

For the photo gallery, I implemented CSS Grid and media queries to ensure responsive layout across devices. All fonts were defined using @font-face property, and text overflow was managed using ellipsis styling to maintain clean, readable content throughout the site.
